# Eqraa Reader v3.0.0

**Eqraa** is a premium, open-source reading application reimagined for modern Android devices. Built with a focus on immersive design, powerful synchronization, and privacy, Eqraa provides the ultimate reading experience for EPUB, PDF, and Audiobooks.

## What's New in v3.0.0

### 🎨 Immersive & Premium UI
- **Transparent Status Bar**: The app now draws content behind the system status bars for a true full-screen experience.
- **Top-Only Navigation**: We've removed the bottom bar and consolidated controls into a sleek, top-aligned header.
- **Smart Accessibility**: Tap the **Top 20%** of the screen to reveal controls; tap elsewhere to turn pages without distraction.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Strict Black & White theme for high contrast and focus.

### ☁️ Next-Gen Sync (Powered by Supabase)
- **Real-time Progress**: Switch between devices instantly. Your page, bookmark, and highlights sync in real-time.
- **Cloud Library**: Upload your books to the cloud and access them anywhere.
- **Settings Sync**: Your font choices, theme preferences (Sepia/Dark/Light), and text size travel with you.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart handling of concurrent reading sessions across multiple devices.

### 🤖 AI Reading Companion
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Select text to get instant summaries, character analysis, or historical context.
- **Ask AI**: Chat with your book to uncover deeper meanings or clarify complex passages.

### 📚 Comprehensive Format Support
- **EPUB 3**: Full support for rich layout, media overlays, and interactivity.
- **PDF**: Fast rendering with zoom and navigation tools.
- **Audiobooks**: Listen to your books with variable playback speed and sleep timer.
- **LCP**: Support for DRM-protected library content.

## Technical Highlights
